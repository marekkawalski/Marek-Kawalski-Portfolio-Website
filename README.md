<p>
 This project is my portfolio website which serves a purpose of some king of online CV. My foremost goal was to create a website which I can later show 
  to my recruiter during a job interview. I also thought that it could be beneficial for me to learn react.js and become more fluent at web technologies so
  that's why I decided to create this website.
</p>
<p>Speaking of the website itself, my aim was to make it fast, easy to use and responsive. I choose react.js for a reason, namely it forces developer
to write more or less clean code. I recently learned that not only is functionality vital but clean code and good programming practices are crucial as well.</p>
